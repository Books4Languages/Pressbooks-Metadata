## Installation and Upgrades

* Clone (or copy) this repository to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

For upgrades, download the las stable version from github, delete from FTP the old plugin and install the new one.

## Installing Required Plugins

If we were to try to create our plugin without the use of existing plugin solutions we simply would not exist. There is no sustainable way to develop all the functionality needed for our plugin while still being able to offer a competitive price.

* [Custom Metadata Manager](https://github.com/Automattic/custom-metadata) An easy way to add custom fields to your object types (post, pages, custom post types, users) & to generate option pages. PressBooks users have Custom Metadata Manager integrated in the code.

For non PressBooks users, All In One Metadata plugin will let you know with an error that the additional plugin is required and it will provide you with a link so you can download and install it. By clicking the link in the error box you will be provided with the required plugin, upload the plugin to your Wordpress installation using one of the two ways described above when we were installing All In One Metadata, activate the plugin and the error will go away. Now we can start using our newly installed plugin.

## Integrations

All in one metadata works out of the box with:

* [PressBooks](http://github.com/pressbooks/pressbooks/) is a book content management system which exports in multiple formats: ebooks, webbooks, print-ready PDF, and various XML flavours. Pressbooks is built on top of WordPress Multisite.

We are focus with the metadata, all the other SEO solutions can be find trough other plugins:

* [The SEO Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/)
* [All in one SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/)
* [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)

Not all the plugins are 100% integrated with All in one metadata, some of them works in the site for an enhancement of the features of the site. From the settings page, you can choose to deactivate some of the JSON-LD schema metadata for some integrated plugins.
